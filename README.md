## What is ExoPlayer?
ExoPlayer is an application level media player for Android which provides an alternative to Android’s MediaPlayer. It can play audio/video both locally and over the Internet.
Another reason why ExoPlayer is a popular option is that it supports a lot of features, for example, Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) and SmoothStreaming which aren’t supported by MediaPlayer. 

It is very customizable and provides a lot of other features and abilities which can be found: https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/guide.html#pros-and-cons.
